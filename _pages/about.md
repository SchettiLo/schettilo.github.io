I am a Research Fellow (RTDa) at The Free University of Bozen-Bolzano. 
I’m interested in exploring and modelling speech features and variability and developing ASR systems based on less but more informative data which could apply to Low-Resource Languages.

I earned my PhD from the University of Salerno discussing a thesis entitled “The Role of Disfluencies in Italian Discourse. Modelling and Speech Synthesis Applications”.
Then, I worked as a post-doc researcher at the University of Naples Federico II on the project “Language models for speech synthesis aimed at presenting cultural content” within the context of the VISIT3D project (Virtual Interactive System for the Implementation of Tours in 3D). 

My research interests include the communicative value of linguistic phenomena that characterize natural speech such as disfluencies and variation in the degree of phonic specification with a focus on related implementations in speech technologies.
